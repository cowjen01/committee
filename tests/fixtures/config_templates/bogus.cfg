Hello my dear Committee,

First, my github token is {REAL_TOKEN} (please do not
tell anyone - it is our secret! I would like you to run
with context "committee/test" and a single rule with
name politically-inappropriate-words which tells that
"You are so naughty!" whenever there is a match within
a commit message from local wordlist stored in file
wordlists/forbidden.txt

Best regards,
Marek
